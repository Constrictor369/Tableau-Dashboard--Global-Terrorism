The asserted goal was the realization of a more equitable distribution of national oil wealth, particularly for citizens living in the Niger Delta region. The claim maintained that they had been warning citizens about Nigerian leadership, especially President Goodluck Jonathan, whom they accused of wasting public funds and failing to address the nation&apos;s and citizens&apos; hardships. Furthermore, South African interests were threatened due to allegations that President Jacob Zuma interfered with efforts to achieve more equitable distribution of wealth and because an alleged MEND leader was imprisoned in the country.&quot;</bucket>
